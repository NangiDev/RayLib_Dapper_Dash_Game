# This game is a result of following the GameDev.tv c++ course
https://www.gamedev.tv/p/cpp-fundamentals

# Run game
You need to setup Vscode and find replace all the references to my raylib folder with the path to your local raylib folder.

# Conclusion
This course was very basic.
You will learn the pure basics of C++, no advanced things. As a experienced Java developer with basic programmer knowledge this was to basic.

If you are new to programming this is a good start. You will also start getting to know Raylib which is a very powerful framework for game development.

DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS COURSE. Only buy if on sale.
I payed $16.25 and that's a fair price consider the work that went into making this course.

I still enjoyed this course. The quality is good and they teach what they promise. Basic C++.
Sense of completion, when done with the course, is satisfying.
